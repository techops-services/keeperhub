# Performance Monitoring

> **Coming Soon**: Advanced performance monitoring and analytics are currently in development. This page describes planned functionality.

## Planned Features

### Run Analytics Dashboard

A dedicated analytics view will provide:

- **Success Rate Metrics**: Percentage of successful runs over time
- **Execution Time Trends**: Average and peak execution durations
- **Run Volume Statistics**: Number of executions per workflow
- **Error Rate Tracking**: Failure patterns and frequencies

### Gas Usage Analytics

Track blockchain transaction costs:

- Gas spent per workflow
- Gas costs over time
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Network fee comparisons

### Node Performance Insights

Detailed metrics per node:

- Average execution time per node type
- Slowest nodes identification
- Bottleneck analysis
- Optimization suggestions

### Alerting and Thresholds

Proactive monitoring capabilities:

- Alert when success rate drops below threshold
- Notification on unusual execution times
- Gas cost spike warnings
- Run failure alerts

### Historical Data

Long-term data retention:

- Historical run data beyond current session
- Trend analysis over weeks and months
- Export capabilities for external analysis
- Comparison across time periods

## Current Capabilities

While advanced monitoring is in development, you can currently:

- View individual run history in the Runs panel
- See execution times for each node
- Review success/failure status per run
- Copy run data for manual analysis
