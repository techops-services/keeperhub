**IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**

- **Never** share your private key or seed phrase with anyone
- **Do not** store it in email, cloud drives, chat apps, screenshots, or unencrypted notes
- Prefer storing the key/seed **offline**: encrypted password manager (with local vault), an air-gapped USB drive in a safe, or a hardware wallet
- If you must write it down, use a physical copy kept in a secure place (e.g. safe)
- After copying, **clear your clipboard** and close the export screen
