Your KeeperHub user account is the foundation of your platform access. This guide covers account management and user settings.

## Account Creation

New users can create an account through:

- **Email Registration**: Sign up with email and password
- **Social Authentication**: Connect via supported OAuth providers

Upon account creation, a Para wallet is automatically generated and associated with your account.

## User Profile

Your profile contains:

- **Display Name**: How you appear to other organization members
- **Email Address**: Used for account access and notifications
- **Para Wallet Address**: Your associated blockchain wallet

## Account Settings

Access your account settings to:

- Update display name
- Change email address
- Manage authentication methods
- View wallet information

## Personal Workflows

As an individual user, you can:

- Create workflows in your personal workspace
- Test and deploy automations
- Access your run history
- Manage notification connections

## Organization Membership

Users can belong to one or more organizations:

- Accept invitations to join organizations
- Access shared workflows within organizations

See [Organizations](/docs/users-teams-orgs/organizations) for details on organization features.

## API Access

Generate API keys for programmatic access:

- Create keys for workflow management

See [API Authentication](/docs/api/authentication) for details.

## Data and Privacy
