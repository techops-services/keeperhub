# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with KeeperHub in minutes by creating your first automation workflow.

## Step 1: Create Account

Visit app.keeperhub.com and sign up with your email address. A Para wallet is automatically created for your account, giving you a secure way to execute blockchain transactions.

## Step 2: Access Your Wallet

Click your profile icon in the top right and select **Wallet** to view your Para wallet address. Top up this wallet with ETH (on Mainnet or Sepolia testnet) to enable operations that require gas fees.

## Step 3: Create Your First Workflow

Click the workflow dropdown in the top left and select **New Workflow** to open the visual workflow builder.

### The Workflow Canvas

The workflow builder is a visual node-based editor where you build automations by connecting nodes:

- **Trigger Nodes**: Start your workflow (Scheduled, Webhook, Event, Block, Manual)
- **Action Nodes**: Perform operations (Check Balance, Send Email, Send Discord Message, etc.)
- **Condition Nodes**: Add branching logic based on results

### Adding Nodes

You can add nodes to your workflow in multiple ways:
- Click the **+** button in the top toolbar
- Right-click on the canvas to open the context menu
- Drag from an existing node's connector point

### Example: Wallet Balance Watcher

Let's create a workflow that monitors a wallet balance and sends notifications when it's low:

1. **Add a Scheduled Trigger**: Set it to run every 5 minutes
2. **Add a Check Balance node**: Configure it to check a wallet's ETH balance
3. **Add a Low Balance Condition**: Set a threshold (e.g., balance < 0.1 ETH)
4. **Add notification actions**: Connect Email and Discord nodes to alert when the condition is met

## Step 4: Configure Nodes

Click any node to open the configuration panel on the right side:

### For Web3 Actions (like Check Balance):
- **Service**: Select the service type (Web3)
- **Connection**: Choose your connected wallet
- **Network**: Select Sepolia Testnet or Ethereum Mainnet
- **Address**: Enter the wallet or contract address to monitor
- **Label**: Give your node a descriptive name
- **Description**: Optional notes about what this node does

### For Notification Actions:
- **Connection**: Select or create a connection (Email, Discord, Slack)
- **Message**: Configure the notification content

## Step 5: Set Up Connections

Before using notification actions, configure your connections:

1. Click your profile icon and select **Connections**
2. Add connections for the services you want to use:
   - **Email**: Configure email delivery
   - **Discord**: Add your Discord webhook URL
   - **Slack**: Connect your Slack workspace

## Step 6: Enable and Run

1. Click the **Enabled** toggle on each node you want active
2. Click the green **Run** button in the top toolbar to test your workflow
3. Your workflow will now execute based on the trigger configuration

## Using AI to Build Workflows

KeeperHub includes an AI assistant to help you build workflows. Click the **Ask AI...** input at the bottom of the canvas and describe what you want to automate in plain language.

Example prompts:
- "Monitor my wallet and alert me on Discord if balance drops below 0.5 ETH"
- "Check a smart contract function every hour and send an email with the result"
