# Notification Templates

This document provides standardized notification templates for KeeperHub operations. These templates are used across Discord, Slack, and Email notifications.

## Template Types

Notification templates depend on **Keeper Type** and **Trigger Type**:

### Keeper Types
- **Contract**: Smart contract interactions
- **Wallet**: Wallet monitoring and operations  
- **Multisig**: Multisig wallet monitoring

### Trigger Types
- **Manual**: User-triggered execution
- **Cron**: Time-based scheduling
- **Block**: Block-based triggers
- **Event**: Event-driven triggers

### Contract Keeper Templates
For Contract keepers, templates further depend on **Function Type**:

#### Read Functions
- **Contract Read Template**: For read-only function calls

#### Write Functions  
- **Contract Write Template (Success)**: For successful write transactions
- **Contract Write Template (Failure)**: For failed write transactions

### Event Trigger Templates
- **Event Template**: For Event detection (used across all keeper types when Event trigger is selected)

### Wallet & Multisig Keeper Templates
- **Balance Change Template**: For wallet balance monitoring
- **Threshold Template**: For threshold-based actions
- **Ownership Change Template**: For multisig ownership changes
- **Transaction Template**: For wallet/multisig transactions
