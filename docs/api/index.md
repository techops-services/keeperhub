# API Overview

The KeeperHub API allows you to programmatically manage workflows, integrations, and executions.

## Base URL

```
https://app.keeperhub.com/api
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication via either:
- **Session**: Browser-based authentication via Better Auth
- **API Key**: For programmatic access (see [API Keys](/api/api-keys))

## Response Format

All responses are returned as JSON with the following structure:

### Success Response
```json
{
  "data": { ... }
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable message"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limits

API requests are subject to rate limiting. Current limits:
- 100 requests per minute for authenticated users
- 10 requests per minute for unauthenticated requests

## Available Endpoints

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Workflows](/api/workflows) | Create, read, update, delete workflows |
| [Executions](/api/executions) | Monitor workflow execution status and logs |
| [Integrations](/api/integrations) | Manage notification and service integrations |
| [Chains](/api/chains) | List supported blockchain networks |
| [User](/api/user) | User profile and preferences |
