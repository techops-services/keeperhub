## Persistent Test Account

The seed script `scripts/seed/seed-test-wallet.ts` provisions a persistent test account used by both Playwright and vitest E2E tests. It is idempotent -- safe to run multiple times.

```bash
pnpm db:seed-test-wallet
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Email | `pr-test-do-not-delete@techops.services` |
| Password | `TestPassword123!` |
| Org Slug | `e2e-test-org` |
| Org Name | `E2E Test Organization` |
| Role | `owner` |

The script also seeds a **Para wallet** (EVM) linked to the test organization, required for `write-contract-workflow.test.ts` and any test that needs on-chain signing. The wallet data is hardcoded from the pre-provisioned Para wallet (same wallet used by keeper-app). No Para API calls are made at seed time.

**Environment variables required for wallet seeding:**

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection |
| `TEST_PARA_USER_SHARE` | Raw Para user share (base64) |
| `WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encrypts user share at rest |

If these env vars are missing, the user + org are still created but the wallet step is skipped.

## When to Write a Playwright Test vs a Vitest E2E Test

### Playwright (browser E2E)

Use Playwright when the test **requires a browser** or validates **user-visible behavior**:

- UI rendering, layout, and interaction (clicks, form fills, drag-and-drop)
- Navigation flows (sign up, onboarding, page transitions)
- Visual state after actions (toasts, error messages, saved configs reloading)
- Full user journeys that start in the browser ("create workflow, configure trigger, save, reload, verify")

Playwright tests live in `tests/e2e/playwright/`. They run against a live (or deployed) app with a real database. The test user authenticates through the actual sign-up/login UI or via the persistent test account.

**Config:** `playwright.config.ts` -- single worker, chromium only, auto-starts `pnpm dev` locally.

### Vitest E2E (API/infrastructure)

Use Vitest when the test validates **backend behavior** that does not need a browser:

- API endpoint correctness (auth, status codes, response shapes)
- Database operations and record lifecycle (create, update, query execution records)
- Infrastructure integration (SQS send/receive, DB connectivity, RPC failover)
- Script behavior (workflow-runner exit codes, graceful shutdown, signal handling)
- On-chain interactions (balance checks, gas estimation, nonce management, real transactions)
- Pipeline flows (dispatcher -> SQS -> executor -> API -> runner)

Vitest E2E tests live in `tests/e2e/vitest/`. They connect directly to the database and infrastructure services. Some spawn child processes (workflow-runner). Some hit live RPC endpoints.

**Config:** `vitest.config.mts` -- excludes `tests/e2e/playwright/`, uses `tests/setup.ts` for mocks and env defaults.

### Decision rule

If the assertion is about **what the user sees in the browser**, use Playwright.
If the assertion is about **what happens in the database, queue, API, or chain**, use Vitest.

## Running CI Locally with `act`

[nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) can emulate GitHub Actions workflows locally. The default `catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest` image is missing tools that GitHub runners include (`pg_isready`, `aws`), so we build a custom image.

### One-time setup

```bash
# Build custom runner image with postgresql-client and awscli
cat > /tmp/Dockerfile.act << 'EOF'
FROM catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends postgresql-client python3-pip \
    && pip3 install awscli --break-system-packages \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
EOF
docker build -t act-runner:local -f /tmp/Dockerfile.act /tmp
```

### Create a secrets file

```bash
# /tmp/act-secrets.env
TEST_WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-byte hex key>
TEST_PARA_USER_SHARE=<base64 user share>
```

### Run the e2e-vitest job

```bash
act push --job e2e-vitest \
  --secret-file /tmp/act-secrets.env \
  --platform ubuntu-latest=act-runner:local \
  --pull=false
```

`--pull=false` prevents act from trying to pull the local image from Docker Hub.

|------|---------|
| `tests/setup.ts` | Vitest global setup -- mocks `server-only`, sets env defaults |
| `tests/utils/db.ts` | Shared DB helpers: `createTestWorkflow`, `waitForWorkflowExecution`, `createApiKey`, `getUserIdByEmail` |
| `tests/fixtures/workflows.ts` | Workflow builders: `createScheduledWorkflow`, `createWebhookWorkflow`, trigger/action node factories, cron presets |
| `tests/fixtures/workflow-runner-harness.ts` | Harness for spawning workflow-runner as child process |
| `tests/e2e/playwright/utils/auth.ts` | `signUpAndVerify()` for Playwright browser auth |
| `tests/e2e/playwright/utils/db.ts` | Playwright-specific DB utilities |
| `tests/e2e/playwright/utils/workflow.ts` | `waitForWorkflowSave()` and other Playwright workflow helpers |
| `tests/e2e/playwright/utils/discover.ts` | Page discovery: `probe()`, `diffReports()`, `autoProbe()`, `highlightElements()` |

---

## Playwright Discovery Framework

Tools for understanding page structure before writing E2E tests. Solves the problem of guessing selectors blind, running the test, failing, and repeating.

### Commands

```bash
pnpm discover /                        # Discover unauthenticated page
pnpm discover / --auth --highlight     # Authenticated with numbered element overlays
pnpm discover / --steps "click:button:has-text('Sign In')" "wait:500" "probe:dialog"
pnpm discover / --json                 # JSON to stdout
```

### Output

Each probe writes to `tests/e2e/playwright/.probes/<label>-<timestamp>/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `screenshot.png` | Full page screenshot |
| `screenshot-highlighted.png` | Interactive elements with numbered red overlays |
| `elements.md` | Interactive elements table grouped by page region |
| `accessibility.md` | Parsed accessibility tree (roles, names, states) |
| `aria-snapshot.yaml` | Raw Playwright ARIA snapshot for writing `getByRole` locators |
| `diff.md` | What changed between two probes (new/removed elements, dialogs, toasts) |
| `report.json` | Full structured data |

### In-Test Usage

```typescript
import { probe, diffReports, autoProbe } from "./utils/discover";

// Manual probe at specific points
const before = await probe(page, "before-click");
await page.click('button:has-text("Sign In")');
const after = await probe(page, "after-click");
const diff = diffReports(before, after);

// Auto-probe on every URL change (only when PW_DISCOVER=1)
const handle = await autoProbe(page);
// ... test interactions ...
handle.stop();
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `PW_DISCOVER=1` | Enable auto-probing on navigation in tests |
| `CI` | When set, disables auto-probing regardless of `PW_DISCOVER` |

### Explore Harness

`tests/e2e/playwright/explore.test.ts` is a scratchpad for iterative exploration:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e --grep "explore"              # Run exploration
PW_DISCOVER=1 pnpm test:e2e --grep "explore"  # With auto-probing
```

Edit the steps in the file, run, read `.probes/` output, edit again, repeat until you understand the page structure. Then write the real test in a new file.
