 * `encodeFunctionData` output - the `transfer(address,uint256)` selector plus
 * two 32-byte ABI words - and `value` is wei as a decimal string.
 *
 * The addresses are placeholders on purpose. A live token address would be
 * wrong twice over: this response carries no chain identifier, so an address
 * that only has code on one chain silently no-ops when broadcast anywhere
 * else, and calldata a reader could sign turns the obvious smoke test - paste
 * the documented body into a signer - into an irreversible transfer. `to` is a
 * plainly fictitious contract and the recipient is the burn address, so the
 * bytes decode correctly and mean nothing.
 *
 * `to` is the target the caller broadcasts to on the workflow's own chain: the
 * workflow's contract for a single write, MULTICALL3 for a batch write
 * (lib/mcp/calldata.ts:352). It is unrelated to x-payment-info, which says
 * where the caller pays KeeperHub.
 *
 * Plural `examples` because this is an OpenAPI 3.1 document: singular
 * `example` is deprecated inside Schema Objects, and ERROR_SCHEMA already uses
 * the plural form.
