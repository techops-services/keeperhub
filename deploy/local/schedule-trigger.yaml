# Schedule Trigger Components for KeeperHub
# These are deployed separately from the main app to allow independent scaling
#
# Components:
# 1. ConfigMap with scheduler environment
# 2. CronJob for dispatcher (runs every minute)
# 3. Deployment for executor (long-running SQS consumer)
#
# IMPORTANT: For local development, you need to run:
#   minikube mount $(pwd):/app
# This mounts the local codebase into minikube at /app
#
# For production, build the scheduler into the keeperhub Docker image
# and use the same image with different entrypoints.
