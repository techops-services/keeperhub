# Schedule Trigger Components for KeeperHub (Full K8s Mode)
# These are deployed separately from the main app to allow independent scaling
#
# Components:
# 1. ConfigMap with scheduler environment
# 2. RBAC (ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding)
# 3. CronJob for dispatcher (runs every minute, polls DB, sends to SQS)
# 4. Deployment for executor (polls SQS, executes workflows via API)
#
# Images required (built from keeperhub-scheduler submodule):
#   - keeperhub-dispatcher:latest (for dispatcher CronJob)
#   - keeperhub-executor:latest (for executor Deployment)
#
# Build images:
#   make build-scheduler-images
