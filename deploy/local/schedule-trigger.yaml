# Schedule Trigger Components for KeeperHub
# These are deployed separately from the main app to allow independent scaling
#
# Components:
# 1. ConfigMap with scheduler environment
# 2. RBAC (ServiceAccount, Role, RoleBinding) for job spawner
# 3. CronJob for dispatcher (runs every minute)
# 4. Deployment for job-spawner (polls SQS, creates K8s Jobs)
#
# Images required:
#   - keeperhub-scheduler:latest (for dispatcher and job-spawner)
#   - keeperhub-runner:latest (for workflow execution jobs)
#
# Build images:
#   docker build --target scheduler -t keeperhub-scheduler:latest .
#   docker build --target workflow-runner -t keeperhub-runner:latest .
#   minikube image load keeperhub-scheduler:latest
#   minikube image load keeperhub-runner:latest
